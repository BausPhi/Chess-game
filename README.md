# Chess-game

This is a simple chess game written in python, but with a speciality.
You can play against a chess bot or even let two bots play against each
other. The bot was also written by myself.

### Install and execute the game:

    1. Clone the repository
    2. Go to the source folder, where the main.py file can be found
    2. Execute "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
    3. Execute "python3 main.py"
    4. Enjoy the game

### The chess bot
The chess bot was written in Python too and uses machine learning/deep
learning to play the game. I used a convolutional neural network as these
neural networks perform well on such tasks.

The bot is also available in a
<a href="https://github.com/BausPhi/Chess-Bot">GitHub repo</a> on my account
if you are interested in it.
