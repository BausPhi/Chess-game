# Chess-game

This is a simple chess game written in python, but with a speciality.
You can play against a chess bot or even let two bots play against each
other. The bot was also written by myself.

### Install and execute the game:

    1. Clone the repository
    2. Go to the source folder, where the main.py file can be found
    2. Execute "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
    3. Execute "python3 main.py"
    4. Enjoy the game
